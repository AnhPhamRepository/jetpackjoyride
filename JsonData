This ability would later be given to the Phaser Jetpack. \n The Machine Gun Jetpack made it's first appearance as a weapon in Monster Dash, another game made by Halfbrick, which also stars Barry Steakfries. \n This is one of three jetpacks (others being the Shark Head Jetpack and the Rainbow Jetpack) to have a gold variant, in this case the Gold Platinum MGJP.",

In July 2014, it was on sale for 37,500 coins (25% off).

This period is notorious for people wasting money (and getting into debt) for average conditions. \n While scientists are attracted by this jetpacks dollar bills, they run in fear from Profit Bird, despite also dropping money. \n Unlike other jetpacks, the scientists don't change into panic mode when user gets a vehicle and still run towards Barry. This can also make them run towards the aformentioned Profit Bird, as if it functioned similarly to Golden Piggy Pack. \n This jetpack can help with high five scientist missions by causing scientists to run towards you. Tap the screen to trigger the chase which helps to reach the number of scientists to high five quicker. The scientists only chase after the bills, so it's recomended not to wear the Air Barrys, and 'skip' along the ground to keep releasing money. \n This jetpack could no longer attract scientists as of version 1.6.1. of the game, though the effect was reverted back from 1.7.0 onward. \n This jetpack can be used for free during Bling It On!

There are some particular areas that regularly spawn the best weapons and armor such as the military base, power plant, or the various major towns in the original map Erangel, but bare in mind that other seasoned players will be heading there too.Once you’ve jumped out of the cargo plane, keep an eye out for swarms of other players heading to a single location and avoid those areas like the plague. Likewise, don’t just aimlessly drift once you’re in freefall—pinpoint a safe enough area, preferably with buildings so you can grab some loot, and push forward to speed your way there. Buildings will show up as white blocks on the mini map, so make sure you’re heading in the right direction. If you can’t see one you can always open your parachute early and coast over to a decent landing zone. Just be aware that every second you spend in the sky is a second your opponents will be using to scoop up loot.",
