This ability would later be given to the Phaser Jetpack. \n The Machine Gun Jetpack made it's first appearance as a weapon in Monster Dash, another game made by Halfbrick, which also stars Barry Steakfries. \n This is one of three jetpacks (others being the Shark Head Jetpack and the Rainbow Jetpack) to have a gold variant, in this case the Gold Platinum MGJP.",

In July 2014, it was on sale for 37,500 coins (25% off).

This period is notorious for people wasting money (and getting into debt) for average conditions. \n While scientists are attracted by this jetpacks dollar bills, they run in fear from Profit Bird, despite also dropping money. \n Unlike other jetpacks, the scientists don't change into panic mode when user gets a vehicle and still run towards Barry. This can also make them run towards the aformentioned Profit Bird, as if it functioned similarly to Golden Piggy Pack. \n This jetpack can help with high five scientist missions by causing scientists to run towards you. Tap the screen to trigger the chase which helps to reach the number of scientists to high five quicker. The scientists only chase after the bills, so it's recomended not to wear the Air Barrys, and 'skip' along the ground to keep releasing money. \n This jetpack could no longer attract scientists as of version 1.6.1. of the game, though the effect was reverted back from 1.7.0 onward. \n This jetpack can be used for free during Bling It On!

The cockpit has a glass window on it, and in the front of the cockpit is where Barry Steakfries (and Flash if equipped) is seated. When it is damaged by missiles which are not blocked, the robot becomes cracked and charred, and some parts start smoking. The visual damage done depends on where the missiles strike it. When collected, the vehicle goes through three dramatic assemblage sequences (instead of one, like small vehicles). By piloting S.A.M., all Zappers and Lasers are gone, and Missiles become the only obstacle. Because of this, S.A.M.'s giant arm has a glowing barrier-like aura of energy that acts as a powerful deflective barrier. By pressing the screen, S.A.M.'s arm moves up, and when released, moves back down. The arm’s energy barrier must to be used to deflect any incoming missiles. Coins are also set up in patterns only seen by using S.A.M. S.A.M. is also unique in the fact that it can take up to 3 hits until it is defeated. When it is, it will have a slow, dramatic explosion as the screen fades white, and you return to standard gameplay.",

Nerd Repellent is a gadget which closes down the whole laboratory, and gives it an abandoned appearance. There are no scientists, tumbleweeds roll on the ground, and the red flashing lights turn off. It also makes some door lights flicker, some of the doors have cobwebs on them, and some lights flicker on and off. Although it is often overlooked due to its seemingly aesthetic use, it can be useful (e.g. if the player wants to avoid scattering or touching any scientists). It is especially helpful when trying to get the Germaphobe achievement, where you must travel 2 km without touching any coins, scientists or spin tokens, which can be very difficult to get without Nerd Repellent. It makes the “High Five x Scientists” missions impossible. Otherwise, its effects are mainly aesthetic, and provides a change from the normal scenery.",

      "content": "The game mechanics are simple. The main controls involve tap, hold or release to hover, fly up or descend accordingly. These types of games have been quite popular among casual gamers. At the start, Barry will begin the game using his Machinegun jetpack that fires bullets downward, which helps him fly and collect coins that appear on the different portions of the screen. Eventually, the game introduces automatic handheld guns that will shoot when an opponent is on the screen. A normal gun will fire bullets continuously in a straight line, while if you activate a power-up you might have a gun that shoots in different directions like the CrossFire gun. There are power-ups such as the CrossFire gun to help push through some distance, they can be activated by collecting a power-up token that appears at a random place in the game, it can be identified by the shining icon with a question mark on it. There are some garage items that help on the way. These garage inventions include Big Stomper (A Mechanical Robot) which will crush anything on its way and takes all the damage. These inventions can be unlocked and managed in the garage. They can be activated by collection the token marked with a spanner on it. The challenges include dodging electric blockers, missiles and bullets and destroying or evading different enemies (melee and ranged). Melee enemies occupy a part of the screen, while ranged enemies use missiles and guns. These missiles and guns can be either targeted (will follow Barry on screen until impact or destroyed) or untargeted (only travels horizontally without deviation until impact or evaded). Earlier, Jetpack Joyride was an endless runner, but in this game, they have introduced an endpoint to each level. Scores are calculated based on the survival time and enemies destroyed. Once you reach a particular score shown on the top center, you will alert the boss. Boss levels can be tough and they will have a health bar too when you kill the boss the laboratory level ends and the new lab level opens. Each of these laboratories will have different enemies. These laboratories can be viewed under the story map option available at the bottom left corner of the main screen. The Level ends when you lose full health or if you finish off the boss. The number of games you can play continuously is affected with the introduction of energy, each and every game will consume energy which will take some time to refill.",
